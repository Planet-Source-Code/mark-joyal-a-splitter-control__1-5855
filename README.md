## A Splitter Control


</div>

### Description

This is a splitter control with 2 panes. I found the initial code out on the web somewhere, but it had a few bugs and was missing a few features I wanted, so I added the ability to colorize the splitter bar and the code now fires an event when the splitter is resized to allow for controls within controls to handle a resize. I also cleaned up the code and fixed a few bugs.

BTW : You can add splitters within splitters to create more than just 2 panes.
